ARC Trainer Documentation
This document provides a comprehensive guide for understanding and using the ARC Trainer system. It covers the architecture, individual components, and their functionalities.
Overview
The ARC Trainer is designed to assist in solving ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) tasks by leveraging language games, Prolog reasoning, machine learning, and a Redis-backed knowledge graph. The system supports dynamic rule generation, validation, and fine-tuning for generalization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core Components
1. Frontend
●
index.html: User interface for interacting with ARC tasks.
●
js/common.js: Shared utilities for grid manipulation.
●
js/testing_interface.js: Handles user inputs and task testing.
●
js/language_game.js: Implements frontend logic for language games.
●
css/common.css: General styles for the interface.
●
css/testing_interface.css: Styles specific to ARC task interactions.
2. Backend
Core Functionality
●
app.py: Main Flask application for routing and API handling.
●
kg.py: Redis-backed Knowledge Graph management.
●
language_game.py: Handles reasoning and logic for language games.
●
grid.py: Manages grid transformations and processing.
●
llm.py: Interfaces with an LLM for reasoning and explanation generation.
New Modules
●
prolog_rule_generator.py: Dynamically generates, validates, and stores Prolog rules.
●
counterexample_finder.py: Identifies counterexamples for rule refinement.
●
kg_visualizer.py: Visualizes the knowledge graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
●
metrics_dashboard.py: Provides system and task performance metrics through an API.
●
language_game_trainer.py: Trains machine learning models for specific language games.
●
llm_fine_tuner.py: Fine-tunes pre-trained language models on ARC-specific tasks.
●
user_feedback.py: Collects and processes user feedback for continuous improvement.
●
task_manager.py: Manages task submission, processing, and status tracking.

2. Workflow
1.
Submit Tasks:
○
Use the Task Manager API (/tasks) to submit ARC tasks.
2.
Process Tasks:
○
Monitor task progress through the Task Manager (/tasks/<task_id>).
3.
Refine Rules:
○
Use the Counterexample Finder to identify rule failures.
○
Update Prolog rules with the Rule Generator.
4.
Train Models:
○
Use language_game_trainer.py for ML training.
○
Fine-tune the LLM with llm_fine_tuner.py.
5.
Feedback Integration:
○
Collect user feedback via the User Feedback API.
○
Incorporate feedback into rule and model updates.
6.
Visualize Knowledge:
○
Use the Knowledge Graph Visualizer to understand relationships and dependencies.

API Reference
Task Manager
●
POST /tasks: Submit a task.
●
GET /tasks/<task_id>: Retrieve task status.
User Feedback
●
POST /feedback: Submit user feedback.

Ensure Redis is running and reachable using the configured host and port.
●
Task Failures:
○
Check logs for task-specific errors.
○
Validate input formats and API payloads.
●
Rule Validation Issues:
○
Use the Counterexample Finder to debug failing rules.

The provided text details the development of an AI system, ARC Trainer, designed to solve abstract reasoning challenges. This involves creating Prolog rules for various domains (geometry, combinatorics, number theory), a Python backend for task management and knowledge graph interaction, and a frontend for user interaction. The system incorporates an LLM for reasoning assistance and utilizes Redis for data storage. Further documentation covers setup instructions, counterexample finding, and intellectual property protection strategies.
