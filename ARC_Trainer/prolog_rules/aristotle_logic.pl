% ============================
% Aristotelian Logic with Monte Carlo Reasoning
% ============================

% Classical Syllogism:
% If A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C.
syllogism(A, B, C) :- 
    premise(A, B),
    premise(B, C),
    conclusion(A, C).

% Example: All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal.
premise(all_men, mortal).
premise(socrates, all_men).
conclusion(socrates, mortal).

% ============================
% Fairness Constraints
% ============================

% A rule is considered valid only if it does not create a biased or deceptive outcome.
valid_rule(Rule) :-
    \+ biased_outcome(Rule),
    \+ near_enemy(Rule).

biased_outcome(Rule) :-
    affects_unfairly(Rule, Group),
    format("Warning: Rule ~w disproportionately affects group ~w", [Rule, Group]).

affects_unfairly(social_policy, marginalized_group).
affects_unfairly(lending_decision, low_income_applicants).

% ============================
% Monte Carlo Probabilistic Logic
% ============================

monte_carlo_validation(Rule, Probability) :-
    findall(Outcome, simulate_rule(Rule, Outcome), Outcomes),
    count_success(Outcomes, Successes),
    length(Outcomes, Total),
    Probability is Successes / Total,
    Probability > 0.7.  % Threshold for acceptance

simulate_rule(Rule, valid) :-
    random_member(RuleVariation, [Rule, variation1, variation2, variation3]),
    valid_rule(RuleVariation).

simulate_rule(_, invalid).

count_success([], 0).
count_success([valid | Tail], N) :- count_success(Tail, M), N is M + 1.
count_success([invalid | Tail], N) :- count_success(Tail, N).

% ============================
% Near Enemy Detection
% ============================

% Near Enemy Detection: Rules that seem valid but introduce deception.
near_enemy(Rule) :-
    appears_fair(Rule),
    hidden_bias(Rule),
    format("Warning: Rule ~w appears valid but introduces deception", [Rule]).

% Example near enemy case: Fair-sounding policy that actually discriminates
appears_fair(equal_treatment).
hidden_bias(equal_treatment) :-
    affects_unfairly(equal_treatment, marginalized_group).

% ============================
% Socratic Reasoning Hooks
% ============================

socratic_question(Rule, Why) :-
    causal_chain(Rule, Explanation),
    format("Why does ~w hold? Because ~w", [Rule, Explanation]).

validate_rule(Rule) :-
    monte_carlo_validation(Rule, Probability),
    socratic_question(Rule, Explanation),
    valid_rule(Rule),
    format("Rule ~w passed Monte Carlo reasoning with confidence ~2f", [Rule, Probability]).
